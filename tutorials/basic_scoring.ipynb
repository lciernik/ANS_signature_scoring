    "# Tutorial scoring with ANS and other gene signature scoring methods\n",
    "The following package contains the Python implementation of the Adjusted Neighborhood Scoring method, as well as of UCell [1], JASMINE [2] (with likelihood or odds-ratio sub-computation), the scoring approach by Tirosh et al. [3], and the two modification of it Tirosh_AG and Tirosh_LVG. We refer to the main article of this work for details on the scoring methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Content tutorial**:\n",
    "- In the first part of this tutorial, we show the *basic usage* of the available gene signature scoring methods. \n",
    "- In the second part, we show the application of *GMM postprocessing* for comparable score ranges. \n",

    "We used our preprocessed version of the PBMC dataset and the DGEX list published by Hao et al. 2021 [4]. We will use the preprocessed dataset containing B-cells, monocytes, and natural killer cells. The preprocessed dataset can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15DiWGfSoqtt6Fl2tK_0ik-w50rn30LQA/view?usp=drive_link) and the DGEX list [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a3Uqky2VZxCxLvGI-soCTUp3lijrfrx7/view?usp=drive_link).
